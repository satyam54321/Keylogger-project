The project aims to develop a basic keylogger for educational purposes only. The project will explore the technical aspects of capturing and logging keystrokes on a computer system while emphasizing the importance of privacy, consent, and ethical considerations.
The scope of this project will be limited to the development of a keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes on a single computer. 
The application should be designed for educational purposes only, with built-in safeguards to prevent the logging of sensitive information 
and to obtain user consent. ![image](https://github.com/satyam54321/Keylogger-project/assets/91941042/49fab65f-09bd-44d4-bc01-00e75a5816bb)
